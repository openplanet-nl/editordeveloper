# Editor Developer Tools
This plugin ships with Openplanet, and provides a couple extra features in the editor.

* Adds back the offzone tool to the editor.
* Adds the option to disable mouse-on-edge camera movement.
* Adds the option to show some (old) Nadeo developer tools. They are mostly non-functional nowadays.
